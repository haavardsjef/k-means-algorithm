# K-means algorithm

This repository contains all resources for Homework 1 of TDT4173 fall 2021.

## Problem Description

In this assignment I will be developing two well-known and simple (but occasionally very useful) machine learning algorithms. The interface I am implementing strongly resembles the one used in [Scikit Learn]( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

## K-means algorithm

## Decision tree


## Overview
- The <algorithm_name>.py files (e.g. k_means.py) contains the implementation of the algorithm.
- For each algorithm, there are two datasets that has been used to test the algorithm. 
  - The data_1.csv files contain easy problems.
  - The data_2.csv files contain harder problems.
- The report.pdf file contains results, plots and descriptions of the work.
- The experiment.ipynb files are jupyter notebooks with  code for loading the datasets, training, and evaluating the models.
