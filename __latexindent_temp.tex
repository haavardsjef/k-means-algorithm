\section{K-means algorithm}
For my first algorithm i have decided to implement the K-means algorithm
, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm for data classification.

\subsection{First dataset}
The first dataset contains points in a 2D space, where the points seem to have
a natural separation into two clusters. The implementation of the algorithm
seems to have no issues with this dataset.

    \label{fig:dataset1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Second dataset}

The second dataset is a bit harder, where the points are still in a 2D space,
but does not longer have a natural separation into two clusters. Running the kmeans
algorithm with k=10 clusters seems to give a good result as seen in the plots.
